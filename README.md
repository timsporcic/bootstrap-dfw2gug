# GORM Recipes

This is the sample project used for the [GORM Recipes](http://timsporcic.github.com/GORM-Recipes) tutorial.

It consists of a simple Grails project which has two domain classes: Artist and Work.
There is a one-to-many relationship between the two entities.

The other important class is the BootStrap.grooy file which contains all the seed data
for populating the instance of the database we'll use for the recipes.

This project does not contain any controllers, view, etc...  It is meant to be run from
the Grails console to execute queries. See the documentation page above for details.
